print("Hello, world!")

// As opposed to JavaScript, var and let do not both allow you to re-declare values

// will not throw error
var myFavoriteAnimal = "nudibranch"
myFavoriteAnimal = "dog"

// will through error if I uncomment line 11
let encouragement = "You can do it!"
// encouragement = "You got this!"

// How to create a string literal
let theTruth = "Money can't buy me love."

// One way to initialize an empty string
var characterPoorString = ""

// Another way
// Similiar to OO class
let stringWithPotential = String()
